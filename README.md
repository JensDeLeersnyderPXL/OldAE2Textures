**textures that are used in this resoucepack are not made by me. I took these textures from an old version of [Applied Energistics 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2), [extracells2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extracells2) and [wireless crafting terminal](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wireless-crafting-terminal) **
